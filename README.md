# Hexagonal Map Generation and Movement

Have you ever played games like _Sid Meier's Civilization_ or _Teamfight Tactics_ and wondered how they create these hexagonal maps and how movement works on them? Well, if you have, great! Because in this article, we'll be creating just that. If not, you can still give this a read â€” it might be interesting, you never know.

It won't be as beautiful as in those games, but the general idea will be similar.

## How to run

```shell
> cd {PATH-TO-THE-CODEBASE}

You can update values in `settings.py` to create bigger maps.
